# Ideas

- Replace TaggedOffset with a TaggedPtr into the linked list
- Use fetch_add in interner adder to prevent race conditions

# Even More Number Types

- P-adics
  - How do these get represented? Every useful one is infinite
  - May be useful to work with truncated representations, as long as they can produce outputs

# Other Math Stuff

- Rotors
- Quaternions
- All the math stuff I can imagine
